# CNN-DPR-for-IGARSS-2018
The code is for the paper presented in IGARSS2018 namely "Hyperspectral Image Classification  based on A convolutional neural network and discontinuity preserving relaxation"
Before running the code, please download matconvet from the website http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/, and add the folder to the current path in Matlab.
Due to the limitation size of the uploading files, the university of pavia data set is not included, please download it before running the demo for it.
The Demo_ip_patch.m and Demo_PU_patch is the demos fo the two data sets for the algorithm proposed in the paper. 
The DPR.m in the folder is created by Dr. Li for the paper "Li, J., Khodadadzadeh, M., Plaza, A., Jia, X. and Bioucas-Dias, J.M., 2016. A discontinuity preserving relaxation scheme for spectral–spatial hyperspectral image classification. IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 9(2), pp.625-639.". The authors have all the reservation for the contributions.
Please feel free to ask if you have any enquiries or any bugs for the coding.
